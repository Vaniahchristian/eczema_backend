# Chapter 1: Introduction

## 1.1 Background and Scope of the Project

The Eczema Diagnosis and Management System emerges as a response to the growing need for efficient, technology-driven solutions in dermatological healthcare. With the increasing prevalence of eczema affecting approximately 15-20% of children and 1-3% of adults globally, healthcare providers face significant challenges in diagnosis, treatment, and ongoing patient management. This system addresses these challenges through an innovative integration of web technology, artificial intelligence, and healthcare informatics.

The scope of this project encompasses three primary components working in harmony to deliver comprehensive healthcare solutions. The frontend interface, developed using Next.js and TypeScript, provides an intuitive platform for both healthcare providers and patients. The backend infrastructure, built on Node.js with dual database architecture, manages complex medical data and workflows. The machine learning component, implemented in Python with TensorFlow, assists in accurate eczema diagnosis through advanced image processing and pattern recognition.

Our system aims to revolutionize eczema care through several key objectives:
- Streamlining the diagnosis process through AI-assisted image analysis
- Facilitating efficient communication between healthcare providers and patients
- Providing comprehensive treatment tracking and management tools
- Ensuring secure and compliant handling of sensitive medical data
- Supporting data-driven decision making in treatment plans
