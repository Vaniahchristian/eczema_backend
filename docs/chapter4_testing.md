# Chapter 4: Inspection and Testing

## 4.1 Introduction

The inspection and testing of the Eczema Diagnosis and Management System follows a comprehensive test plan that ensures compliance with system requirements, acceptance criteria, and expected use cases. The testing approach considers the system's complexity, potential risks, and integration points between frontend, backend, and ML components.
