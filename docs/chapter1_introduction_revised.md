# Chapter 1: Introduction

## 1.1 Background and Scope of the Project

In Uganda, the healthcare system faces significant challenges in managing dermatological conditions, particularly eczema, which affects a considerable portion of the population. With limited access to specialized dermatological care, especially in rural areas, and a growing patient population, there is an urgent need for innovative solutions that can bridge the healthcare accessibility gap. The Eczema Diagnosis and Management System emerges as a response to these local challenges, leveraging technology to improve healthcare delivery across Uganda.

Recent studies in Uganda indicate that eczema prevalence has been increasing, particularly among children in both urban and rural settings. The shortage of dermatologists, with most specialists concentrated in major urban centers like Kampala, creates significant barriers to timely diagnosis and treatment. Additionally, the traditional paper-based medical records system poses challenges in tracking patient progress and maintaining consistent treatment protocols across different healthcare facilities.

Our system addresses these uniquely Ugandan challenges while maintaining relevance to the global healthcare community. By incorporating local healthcare practices and considering the specific needs of Ugandan healthcare providers and patients, we've developed a solution that is both locally appropriate and internationally applicable. The system takes into account local infrastructure limitations, such as varying internet connectivity and the predominant use of mobile devices for internet access in Uganda.

The scope of this project encompasses three primary components working in harmony to deliver comprehensive healthcare solutions tailored to the Ugandan context:

1. A mobile-first frontend interface, developed using Next.js and TypeScript, providing an intuitive platform accessible even in areas with limited internet connectivity. The interface supports both English and local languages, ensuring wider accessibility across Uganda's diverse population.

2. A robust backend infrastructure, built on Node.js with dual database architecture, designed to handle intermittent connectivity issues common in rural Uganda while managing complex medical data and workflows. The system includes offline capabilities and data synchronization features crucial for rural healthcare settings.

3. A machine learning component, implemented in Python with TensorFlow, specifically trained on diverse skin types prevalent in Uganda and East Africa, ensuring accurate eczema diagnosis through advanced image processing and pattern recognition.

Our system aims to revolutionize eczema care in Uganda through several key objectives:
- Democratizing access to dermatological expertise across urban and rural areas
- Enabling remote diagnosis capabilities to support understaffed rural clinics
- Facilitating efficient communication between the limited number of specialists and general healthcare providers
- Providing comprehensive treatment tracking tools adapted to local healthcare workflows
- Ensuring secure handling of patient data in compliance with Ugandan healthcare regulations
- Supporting data-driven decision making while considering local treatment availability
- Building a knowledge base of eczema cases specific to Ugandan and East African populations
