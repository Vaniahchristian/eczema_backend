# Chapter 4: Inspection and Testing

## 4.1 Introduction

The inspection and testing phase of the Eczema Diagnosis and Management System represents a critical milestone in ensuring the system's reliability, performance, and user satisfaction. Our comprehensive testing approach encompasses multiple layers of validation, from individual components to the entire system integration, ensuring that every aspect of the application meets or exceeds the specified requirements.

The inspection process began with a thorough review of all system components, conducted between May 1st and May 11th, 2025, by the development team led by VC. This included detailed examinations of the frontend architecture, backend API structure, database schema, and machine learning model integration. The team meticulously reviewed all documentation, including API specifications, user manuals, and system architecture documents, ensuring completeness and accuracy.

## 4.2 Test Plan and Performance

### 4.2.1 Test Objectives

Our testing strategy was designed to validate three primary aspects of the system. First, we focused on system reliability, ensuring that all components function correctly and consistently. This included rigorous testing of API endpoints, database operations, and the machine learning model's prediction accuracy. The authentication system underwent particular scrutiny to guarantee data security and user privacy.

Performance testing formed our second objective, where we established strict metrics for system responsiveness. Our targets included API response times under 200 milliseconds, image processing completion within 2 seconds, and the ability to handle over 100 concurrent users without degradation in service quality. These benchmarks were chosen to ensure a smooth and responsive user experience even under heavy load.

The third objective centered on user experience testing, where we evaluated the system's interface responsiveness across different devices and browsers. This included comprehensive accessibility testing to ensure the system meets modern web standards and remains usable for all user groups.

### 4.2.2 Scope and Relevancy of Tests

The testing scope for our system was carefully designed to ensure comprehensive coverage while maintaining practical relevance to real-world usage scenarios. In terms of code coverage, we established a minimum threshold of 90% for critical components, ensuring that all essential functionalities were thoroughly tested. This included comprehensive testing of all API endpoints, user workflows, and cross-platform compatibility.

Volume testing formed a crucial part of our testing strategy, where we simulated real-world conditions with large datasets exceeding 10,000 records. This approach helped us validate the system's ability to handle substantial data volumes while maintaining performance. We conducted stress tests on the image processing system, simulated concurrent user access, and evaluated database performance under various load conditions to ensure system stability at scale.

### 4.2.3 Levels of Tests

Our testing approach was structured across three distinct levels, each serving a specific purpose in validating system functionality. At the module level, we conducted granular testing of individual components, including unit tests for specific functions, validation of API endpoints, and verification of database operations. This foundation ensured that each system component functioned correctly in isolation.

Integration testing served as our second level, where we validated the interactions between different system components. This phase was crucial in ensuring seamless communication between the frontend and backend systems, proper integration of the machine learning model, and reliable database interactions. We paid particular attention to the authentication flow, verifying that user sessions were managed correctly across all system components.

The system acceptance testing represented the final and most comprehensive level of testing. This phase involved end-to-end validation of user workflows, performance benchmarking under real-world conditions, security validation including penetration testing, and cross-browser compatibility testing. This holistic approach ensured that the system not only functioned correctly but also met all user requirements and performance expectations.
