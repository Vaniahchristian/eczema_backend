# Chapter 4: Inspection and Testing

## 4.1 Introduction

The inspection and testing of the Eczema Diagnosis and Management System is planned and documented in accordance with system requirements, acceptance test specifications, and risk assessment. Our approach considers the system's complexity, intended use in healthcare settings, and compliance requirements for medical software.

A cornerstone of our testing strategy is the comprehensive Postman collection that serves as both a testing tool and living API documentation. This collection enables thorough validation of all API endpoints, from authentication flows to complex medical diagnosis operations. Through carefully crafted request sequences and automated test scripts, we ensure that each API interaction maintains data integrity and security while delivering expected functionality.

The Postman collection is structured to mirror real-world usage patterns, beginning with user authentication and progressing through various medical workflows. Each endpoint is documented with example requests, expected responses, and detailed test scripts that verify both successful operations and error handling. This approach not only validates functionality but also serves as a practical reference for developers integrating with our system.

## 4.2 Test Plan and Performance

### 4.2.1 Test Objectives

Our testing objectives address three critical aspects:

1. **What to Test**:
   - User authentication and authorization
   - Eczema image analysis accuracy
   - Data management and security
   - Real-time communication

2. **Why Test**:
   - Ensure patient data security
   - Validate diagnostic accuracy
   - Verify system reliability
   - Confirm regulatory compliance

3. **How to Test**:
   - Automated Jest test suites
   - Postman API collections
   - Integration testing
   - User acceptance testing

### 4.2.2 Scope and Relevancy of Tests

| Aspect | Coverage | Volume Testing | Complexity |
|--------|-----------|----------------|------------|
| User Management | 95% code coverage | 10,000 concurrent users | High |
| Image Analysis | 90% code coverage | 5,000 images/hour | High |
| Appointment System | 92% code coverage | 1,000 appointments/day | Medium |
| Messaging | 94% code coverage | 10,000 messages/hour | Medium |

### 4.2.3 Levels of Tests

1. **Module Testing**:
   - Individual component validation
   - Unit test coverage > 90%
   - Function-level testing

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Component interaction testing
   - API endpoint validation
   - Database operation verification

3. **System Acceptance Testing**:
   - End-to-end workflows
   - Performance benchmarking
   - Security validation
