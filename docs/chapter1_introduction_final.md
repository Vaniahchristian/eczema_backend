# Chapter 1: Introduction

## 1.1 Background and Scope of the Project

In Uganda, the healthcare system faces significant challenges in managing dermatological conditions, particularly eczema, which affects a considerable portion of the population. With limited access to specialized dermatological care, especially in rural areas, there is an urgent need for innovative solutions that can bridge the healthcare accessibility gap. The Eczema Diagnosis and Management System emerges as a response to these local challenges, leveraging technology to improve healthcare delivery across Uganda.

Our system is built on three interconnected components that form a comprehensive healthcare solution:

1. An administrative dashboard (`eczema-dashboard`) built with Next.js and TypeScript, featuring:
   - Role-based access for doctors, researchers, and administrators
   - Patient management interface
   - Appointment scheduling system
   - Analytics dashboard for tracking diagnoses and patient trends
   - Real-time messaging between healthcare providers

2. A secure backend server (`backend`) implemented with Node.js, providing:
   - RESTful API endpoints for data management
   - Dual database system using MySQL and MongoDB
   - Real-time notifications using Socket.IO
   - Comprehensive analytics for patient data
   - Secure authentication and authorization
   - Rate limiting and security measures

3. A machine learning service (`ml_api`) for eczema diagnosis:
   - TensorFlow-based image processing
   - Pre-trained models for skin condition analysis
   - Containerized deployment using Docker
   - API endpoints for diagnosis requests

The system aims to address several critical needs in Uganda's healthcare system:
- Enabling remote diagnosis capabilities for underserved areas
- Providing a centralized platform for patient record management
- Facilitating communication between healthcare providers
- Supporting data-driven healthcare decisions
- Ensuring secure and compliant handling of medical data
