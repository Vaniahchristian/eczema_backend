# Chapter 3: Design Output

## 3.1 Implementation (Coding and Compilation)

The implementation of the Eczema Diagnosis and Management System encompasses a comprehensive technology stack that integrates frontend, backend, and machine learning components. This section details the development tools, system interfaces, and operating environment requirements that form the foundation of our implementation.

### Development Tools and Technologies

The system implementation leverages modern development tools and frameworks across its three main components:

#### Frontend Implementation
The user interface is built using Next.js, a powerful React framework that enables server-side rendering and optimal performance. The frontend implementation incorporates:
- TypeScript for enhanced type safety and code reliability
- Tailwind CSS for responsive and maintainable styling
- Component-based architecture for reusability
- State management for user sessions and data handling

#### Backend Implementation
The server-side implementation utilizes a Node.js environment with Express.js framework, featuring:
- Dual database architecture (MySQL + MongoDB)
- Sequelize ORM for structured data management
- RESTful API design with modular routing
- JWT-based authentication system
- Role-based access control (RBAC)

#### Machine Learning Component
The ML system is implemented using:
- Python with TensorFlow/Keras for model development
- TFLite for model optimization and deployment
- Docker containerization for consistent deployment
- RESTful API endpoints for model inference

### Device Interfaces and Equipment Support
