### 4.2.4 Types of Tests

Our testing strategy encompasses multiple testing types, with Postman collections playing a central role in API validation. The Postman test suite provides comprehensive coverage of our REST API endpoints, enabling both automated testing and interactive exploration. Our collection includes detailed test scripts for authentication flows, eczema diagnosis, and system health monitoring.

The Postman collection is organized into three main folders that reflect our system's architecture:

```json
{
    "info": {
        "name": "Eczema Diagnosis API",
        "description": "API endpoints for the Eczema Diagnosis Advisory System"
    },
    "item": [
        {
            "name": "Authentication",
            "item": [
                "Register User",
                "Login User",
                "Get User Profile",
                "Update Profile"
            ]
        },
        {
            "name": "Eczema Diagnosis",
            "item": [
                "Analyze Image",
                "Update Diagnosis Symptoms",
                "Get Patient History"
            ]
        },
        {
            "name": "System",
            "item": [
                "Health Check"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

Each endpoint in our collection includes authentication headers where required, request body validation, and environment variables for flexible deployment. Here's an example of our login endpoint test:

```javascript
// Login Test Script
pm.test("Login successful", function() {
    var jsonData = pm.response.json();
    if (jsonData.data && jsonData.data.token) {
        pm.environment.set("token", jsonData.data.token);
    }
});
```

Beyond Postman testing, our strategy includes comprehensive input validation across all endpoints:

1. **Authentication Testing**:
   - User registration with required fields (email, password, personal details)
   - Login validation with JWT token generation
   - Profile updates with proper authorization

2. **Eczema Diagnosis Testing**:
   - Image upload validation (format, size limits)
   - Symptom updates for specific diagnoses
   - Patient history retrieval

3. **System Health Testing**:
   - API availability monitoring
   - Service health checks

### 4.2.5 API Testing Environment and Execution

Our Postman environment is configured with essential variables for testing:

```json
{
    "variable": [
        {
            "key": "base_url",
            "value": "http://localhost:5000/api",
            "type": "string"
        },
        {
            "key": "token",
            "value": "",
            "type": "string"
        }
    ]
}
```

The test execution follows our API's workflow:

1. **User Registration and Authentication**:
   ```javascript
   // Register User Request Body
   {
       "email": "test@example.com",
       "password": "Test123!",
       "firstName": "John",
       "lastName": "Doe",
       "dateOfBirth": "1990-01-01",
       "gender": "male",
       "phoneNumber": "+1234567890",
       "address": "123 Test St, City, Country"
   }
   ```

2. **Eczema Image Analysis**:
   ```javascript
   // Image Analysis Request
   // POST {{base_url}}/eczema/analyze
   // Headers: Authorization: Bearer {{token}}
   // Body: form-data
   // - image: file (JPG/PNG, max 5MB)
   ```

3. **Symptom Management**:
   ```javascript
   // Update Symptoms Request Body
   {
       "symptoms": ["itching", "redness", "dryness"],
       "severity": "moderate"
   }
   ```

This structured approach ensures consistent and reliable API testing across all environments. The Postman collection serves as both a testing tool and comprehensive API documentation, making it invaluable for development, testing, and third-party integration.

### 4.2.6 Configuration and Calculation Tests

Platform testing ensures system compatibility across our technology stack. The application is extensively tested on Windows Server 2022, our primary deployment platform, while ensuring optimal performance with Node.js v18.x. Database operations are verified against MongoDB v6.0, with particular attention to data consistency and transaction management. Redis v7.0 integration is tested for caching and session management effectiveness.

Network testing focuses on system behavior under various network conditions. We measure and optimize API latency to ensure responsive user experience, validate WebSocket connections for real-time features, and verify load balancing mechanisms for high availability. Failover scenarios are regularly tested to ensure system resilience.

Integration testing validates the system's interaction with external services. Each third-party API integration undergoes thorough testing to verify proper data exchange and error handling. Payment processing is tested across multiple scenarios to ensure secure and accurate transactions. Email service integration is verified for reliable communication delivery, while storage service testing confirms proper handling of medical images and documents.

Calculation testing is crucial for our medical diagnosis system. We validate the accuracy of diagnosis confidence scoring through comparison with expert-verified results. Treatment effectiveness metrics undergo statistical validation to ensure reliable outcome tracking. Analytics calculations are verified against manual calculations to confirm accuracy, while statistical analysis routines are tested with known datasets to ensure reliable insights generation.

## 4.3 Precautions

### 4.3.1 Anomalous Conditions

Operating in a Windows environment presents several challenges that require careful consideration. Windows update processes can potentially interfere with system operations, particularly during critical diagnostic procedures. To address this, we've implemented a system monitoring protocol that detects and manages update schedules. System resource management is another crucial aspect, as medical image processing and concurrent user sessions can strain available resources. We've observed that file system permissions in Windows environments require special attention, especially when handling sensitive medical data and temporary processing files.

Application-specific anomalies have been identified through extensive testing and real-world usage. Image processing operations occasionally encounter issues with certain file formats or corrupted images, requiring robust error handling and user feedback mechanisms. Database operations, while generally reliable, can face connection issues during peak usage periods. Our monitoring has revealed that cache inconsistencies may arise during rapid data updates, particularly in the appointment scheduling system. Session management anomalies have been observed when users maintain multiple active sessions or during network interruptions.

Through careful analysis and testing, we've established clear system limitations to ensure reliable operation. File size restrictions are set at 10MB per upload, balancing quality requirements for medical images with system performance. The system is architected to handle up to 10,000 concurrent users while maintaining responsive performance. Request rates are limited to 1000 per minute to prevent system overload, and storage capacity is capped at 1TB with automated archiving procedures.

### 4.3.2 Precautionary Steps

To maintain system stability in the Windows environment, we've implemented several critical precautionary measures. The system actively manages Windows update behavior during critical operations, temporarily disabling automatic updates when necessary. Resource allocation is optimized through careful Node.js configuration, with memory limits adjusted based on server capacity and usage patterns. Here's an example of our configuration approach:

```javascript
// Windows update management during critical operations
registryKey.set('AutoUpdateEnabled', false);

// Optimized resource allocation
process.env.NODE_OPTIONS = '--max-old-space-size=8192';
```

Application-level safeguards form another crucial layer of protection. Image processing operations include timeout mechanisms to prevent system hanging, while database connections implement automatic retry logic with exponential backoff. These safeguards ensure system resilience even under challenging conditions:

```javascript
// Robust image processing with timeout protection
const processImage = async (image) => {
    return Promise.race([
        analyzeImage(image),
        new Promise((_, reject) => 
            setTimeout(() => reject('Timeout'), 30000)
        )
    ]);
};

// Resilient database connectivity
mongoose.connect(uri, {
    retryWrites: true,
    retryReads: true,
    serverSelectionTimeoutMS: 5000
});
```

Error recovery procedures have been carefully designed to maintain data integrity and system stability. When unexpected errors occur, the system performs automated cleanup operations to prevent data corruption and ensure proper resource release. This includes transaction rollback, temporary file cleanup, and session management:

```javascript
// Comprehensive error recovery system
process.on('uncaughtException', async (err) => {
    await cleanup();
    logger.error('Uncaught Exception:', err);
    process.exit(1);
});
```

Through these comprehensive precautionary measures, we maintain system reliability while effectively managing various operational challenges. Regular review and updates of these measures ensure that our system remains robust and capable of handling the demands of a medical diagnosis platform. Our approach combines proactive monitoring, automated recovery procedures, and careful resource management to deliver a stable and reliable service.
